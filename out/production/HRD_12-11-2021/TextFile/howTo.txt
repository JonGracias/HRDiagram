How to use an H-R Diagram

H-R diagram is a temperature vs. luminosity graph. Temperature can be classified by its spectral class.
Spectral class is a color index. They are ordered from hottest (blue) to coolest (red).
The types are O,B,A,F,G,K. Absolute Magnitude is the brightness of  a star.
It is dependent on surface area and temperature.
For a star to have a high luminosity and a low temperature the star would have a large surface area. \
For a star hot star to have the same luminosity as a cool star the hot star would have to be much smaller.

This program requires that you select a new tab and enter a name for the star.
To add a star enter a spectral class under Enter Spectral Class prompt
letter type (O,B,A,F,G,K) followed by a number 0-9.

Next enter a number under the Enter Spectral Class prompt (from -15 to 10).
Then hit Add Star and a star will be added to the graph and to the tabbed panel.
Click on star to delete it. Save a panel for future use.
