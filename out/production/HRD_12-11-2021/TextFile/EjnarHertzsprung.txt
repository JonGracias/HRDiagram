Ejnar Hertzsprung
In 1911 Danish chemical engineer, Hertzsprung discovered that equal color implied equal temperature.
The stellar part of the diagram is named for him.
Ejnar Herzsprung was very interested in the chemistry of photography.
In 1902 he applied photography to the measurement of starlight.
In 1905 he published a paper,  “Radiation from stars,” In which he argued that Antonia Maury was right
and different red stars have different spectra (she was calling them c-types).
In 1908 Hertzsprung wrote a paper arguing with Edward Pickering that two stars can have the same
temperature yet different sizes and luminosities.
Hertzsprung studied the Hyades and Pleiades and discovered stars that have the same spectral type have
similar magnitudes.
In 1911, he published his first diagrams that compared color and magnitude.
