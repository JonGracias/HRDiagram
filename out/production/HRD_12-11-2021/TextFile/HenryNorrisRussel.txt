Henry Norris Russel

In 1913, he published his first diagrams that compared color and magnitude groups
using the Harvard spectral classification system. He discovered that graphing
the stars to a chart showed that most stars line up in a diagonal across the chart.
On Dec. 30, 1913 Russel was in a joint meeting with the
American Astronomical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
During this meeting he revealed his diagram and organization method.
The diagram was published for the first time in Nature April 30, 1914.
