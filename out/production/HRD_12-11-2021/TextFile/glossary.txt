Glossary
•	Supergiant: Cool Stars found in the top right of the graph.
    These stars are very large and very bright.

•	Red Giants: Even cooler stars which are not as hot or bright.
    They are above the main sequence but below the supergiant.

•	Main Sequence: The diagonal section that runs from left to right.
    It is where a majority of stars are located.

•	White Dwarfs: A low-mass star that has exhausted most of it nuclear
    fuel and has collapse to a small size. This the end stage of a stars life.
    They are found in the lower left corner.

•	Red Dwarfs: Cool small  stars that do not use a lot of their fuel and therefore
    have a longer life. These are the most common type of star  located on the
    coolest part of the main sequence M.

•	Absolute Magnitude: The brightness of a star as it would be seen at a standard
    distance of 10 parsecs.

•	Spectral Class: Astronomers have devised a classification scheme which describes
    the absorption lines of a spectrum. They have seven categories (OBAFGKM) each of
    which is subdivided into 10 subclasses from 0-9.
