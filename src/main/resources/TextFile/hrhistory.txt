Hertzsprung-Russel Diagram

The creators credited for the Herzsprung-Russel Diagram are
Ejnar Hertzsprung and Norris Russell. They created the diagram independently of each other.
The diagram is a tool that helps astronomers study the correlations between the stars’
luminosity (absolute magnitude) and effective temperature (stellar class) .
The diagram can also help classify stars and interpret it’s size, distance,
chemical composition, when compared to a reference which is the Sun.
Furthermore, the diagram can help us understand the life cycles of stars by studying the
stars in the Main Sequence we can understand common attributes of 90% of all stars. The  H-R diagram,
spectral classes and absolute magnitude have been a huge tool for astronomers to discover different
kinds of stars for instance, Super Giants and Giants.
